Most lovers of dog movies have a certain favorite. If that dog lover is a Disney fan then it's typically a debate between either Lady And The Tramp, or 101 Dalmatians. Now each is just as good as the other, but 101 Dalmatians really feels like a classic and is much more popular with critics and movie fans alike.

This is due to the hilarious moments between the puppies and henchmen which is accompanied by a villain that no one can ever forget and a tune that will be stuck in viewers' heads for weeks.
