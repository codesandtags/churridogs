Starring an acting superhero canine and an owner who would do everything for her dog, this movie is a must-watch and is easily one of the many fantastic Disney movies all about pooches. It tells the tale of Bolt, the superstar acting canine who thinks he actually has real powers. After a mistake in the shipping, Bolt finds his so-called powers put to the test and has to traverse lands he never thought he'd set foot in.


Rather than being a *story* that centers around the love between a pet and its owner, this heartwarming movie explores the life of this charismatic dog and brings with it endless laughter, a few tears, and a truly memorable experience.
