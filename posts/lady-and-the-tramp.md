Disney seems to be at the heart of some of the most believed dog movies ever made. After all, they do seem to have a knack for telling fantastic love stories. So, when the skill in animation, particularly animals, is combined with arguably one of the greatest love stories to ever be told, Lady And The Tramp is born.

It's a heartwarming and exciting exploration into the love between pristine and unconditionally loved Lady, and the rough but mysterious stray. This movie doesn't require a considerable amount of persuading to watch since most have seen and adored it. It's just personal preference as to if the viewer likes the live-action remake or not.
