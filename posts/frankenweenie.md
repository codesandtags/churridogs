Losing a beloved dog is hard for an adult, let alone a child. People don't have the same possibility as the main hero of this movie, a boy named Victor, who decides to bring his dog Frankenweenie back from the dead. He succeeds but causes trouble because of it. Tim Burton has a characteristic directorial style and Frankenweenie fits right in.

The movie has a lot of heart as it captures the bond between Victor and Frankenweenie but can be scary at times, especially for the youngest audience. What's certain is that the dog Frankenweenie doesn't disappoint, (un)dead or not. Burton has based the movie on his 1984 live-action short movie of the same name, but the animated version got more attention from the public.
