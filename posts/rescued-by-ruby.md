One of the latest dog-centered movies that's available on Netflix tells the story of an unlikely friendship of the dog Ruby who doesn't like to do what people want her to and a young policeman who dreams of changing his career and joining the K-9 unit. Together, they'll have to prove they're good enough and also find their way to each other.

The heartwarming story and the sympathetic characters keeps the audience invested. Grant Gustin, best-known for his portrayal of the superhero Barry Allen in the series The Flash, proves that he can pull off multiple genres and thanks to his performance, Ruby herself, and the story, Rescued by Ruby comes across as a feel-good movie.
